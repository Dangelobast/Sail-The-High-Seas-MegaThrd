# Sail-The-High-Seas-MegaThrd
<p align="center">Welcome, This is an unofficial web page Version of the megathread Piracy Sail The High Seas. The main purpose of this repository 
is to give people a local interactive option to navigate "Sail the High Seaas" Megathread and provide a backup in case anything happens.</p><br>
<p><b>For new users that have no idea what is this about, is basically a huge compilation and information about sites and interesting 
places where you can find software, books, tools, adult content and much more things that are interesting. Beaware, I'm not responsible for 
any of the links you decide to search, however there are active users which actively check if a site is safe or not.</b></p>
<p>This information Should be used for informational purposes only, not responsible in you decide to use it for something else.</p>

<p>Be open to save this to your own device and contribute to the project with any interesting links, websites, tools, addons, extensions, game sites, movies, sports.
My second GOAL is to achieve an amazing web page including the most information possible with useful stuff. Even though this is a copy of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/wiki/megathread/">https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/wiki/megathread/</a> (All Credits to them) We would like to add even more information that may not be
on that Megathread and keep updating based on their site too.</p>
