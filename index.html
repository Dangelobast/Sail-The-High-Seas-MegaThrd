     <!-- Main Should be global, meaning it should enclose
    Aside and the actual content in main so elements can float
that's why main cant float around aside, MAIN is the structure
so all elements inside float using flexbox which means i should change
main for another element for the text like (article) and the enclose both
article and aside so it works.-->

        <h1>Welcome To The Wiki</h1>
        <p class="text">This is the start of the page in which you will be able to start looking for
            useful information and sail the high seas. Get ready to find treasures !
            Don't forget to contribute to the project if you have anything that you think
            it should be added to this great resource.<br>
            My main goal is to provide an interactive page which can be saved directly to your 
            device and use for reference down the road in case anything happens to online
            resources since they often get restricted from some content or deleted. However This
            not an intent to support copyright or illegal activity and it should be used as 
            informative material.<br><br>
            Resources should be interesting and meaningful, we plan to expand and add more
            categories based on new content, maybe you found a pack of extensions for a 
            specific purpose, software, addons, Sites for something specific, Useful AI, or 
            anything similar is very welcome here.
